	desc = "A black steel gate hulks before you, creaking in the wind. In pointed steel lettering, you see the words, Our Town Cemetery, jutting from the top of the gate. Beyond the gate, you are able to see the outlines of tombstones, a grim audience forever waiting at the foot of the old church. With the lock broken off and rolling around on the ground, nothing stands in your way from entering into the cathedral's grounds."
