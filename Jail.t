Jail: Room
    name = '<font color="#008800">Jail</font>'
    desc = "<hr/> A small, dank room with an unavoidable musk permeating the air.
        The only light comes from a single, guttering torch. 
        A wall of iron bars separate the northern half of the room from the rest, serving as a cramped cell.
        Ancient, rusty manacles are attached to the side walls at a variety of heights. 
        Occasionally, a rat scampers across the chains and the heavy clanking whispers of the room's darker history."
